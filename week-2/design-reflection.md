##What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

  The 6 phases of Web Design are Information Gathering (1); Planning (2); Design (3); Development (4); Testing and Delivery (5); and Maintenance.

  The information gathering stage is where you do the necessary research to create the most effective website.  This includes the purpose of the site, the goals of the site, the site's target audience, and the site's content

  The planning phase is where you begin to design the structure of the website based on your findings in the previous stage. This includes creating a site map and planning out the hierarchy of the site

  In the design phase, the designer will develop different versions of the site that appeal most to your target audience.  Several prototypes will be developed to assess the most effective layout.

  In the development phase the designer begins to design the shell of the website and distributes content around the site

  The testing phase is where the designer tests the functionality and generaly usability of the site ensuring that everything works as it should before the site is deployed.

  The maintenance phase is an ongoing phase in which the site will be constantly updated and improved either by the web designer or another employee through the use of a CMS like WordPress.

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?</h2>

  My site's primary goal is to give visitors an idea of who I am, what I am all about as well as my accomplishments.  The overarching goal of the site is to appeal to both personal and professional connections. In this regard, I'll include a blog that will be comprised of both personal and professional achievements as well as a resume for potential future employers. I want to keep friends updated on my goings on and I also want employers to not see me simply as a resume, but also as a whole person.  I'm hoping that my projects page will augment my resume and give potential employers a tangible representation of my accomplishments thus far as well as the value I can provide.  I like to think of my site as my expanded resume or Resume 2.0 if you will.

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</h2>

  While I can potentially see some visitors to my site being personal/non-professional connections, my target audience will primarily be professional connections and potential future employers.  To address this target audience I will include links to professional networking sites such as LinkedIn and Angel List.  I will also provide a basic version of my resume as well as a projects section where potential employers can parse through projects I have worked on.  The main goal of my site is to help my stand out from the competition by providing plenty of supplemental materials such as a blog and a project section which will effectively augment my resume.

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</h2>

  There are two primary actions that I would like users to take when visiting my site.  First and foremost I want them to see the projects that I have either created myself or contributed to.  My resume is widely available on LinkedIn as well as many other sites and so that is not the most important part of my website.  Instead,  I am going to highlight the projects and blog sections as those are the two sections that make the site a valuable supplement to my paper resume.  I also want the user to be able to search for information about me, which will be posted in the About Me section.  This section will include various facts about my background and interests and will also include an email link where visitors can email me directly in regards to any inquiries.

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</h2>

  User Experience (UX) is about finding a balance between performance and aesthetics.  This is the reconciliation of the back-end and front-end layers of the stack.  Ideally, your back-end developers are concerned with performance while your front-end developers are primarily interested in an aesthetically and highly usable interface.  UX designers are primarily concerned about creating a pleasurable experience for users.  This includes optimizing the natural flow of the site and ensuring that all features are easily reachable.  This also includes creating an interface that pops, yet is not overwhelming.  A UX designer must also consider performance.  Being conscious of the load that certain media types can put on the server is essential.  Cropping photos, tweaking the quality and staying away from exessive use of multimedia can increase the response time of a site.  Ultimately, an underperforming site will greatly detract from the overall user experience.

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable?</h2>

  User Experience - or UX - design is the process of improving the user experience by designing a platform that is highly usable, accessible, and pleasing to use.  UX design focuses on the theory of human-computer interaciton (HCI) and how to optimize the interactions between users and the client facing side of technology.  Thus, UX design is closely related to web design and front-end development.

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h2>

  Of all the parts of this challenge, I found the article on the 6 phases of web design to be the most tedious.  While it was an interesting article, I found that the author relied a lot on the use of third party CMS's like WordPress and was viewing the process from more of a design rather than a development perspective.  While the article did explicitly claim to be about web design - not development - I found that the author used WordPress and other platforms like it as a crutch instead of diving deeper into the actual development phase of the website.
