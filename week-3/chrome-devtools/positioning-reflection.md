#Peer Programming 3.4 Chrome DevTools

##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements

Chrome's DevTools inspector allows you to make changes to your code and observe those changes in real time.  This makes it incredibly useful when it comes to making incremental changes to your formatting or structure.  For instance, I've found DevTools useful when deciding what type of positioning to use (e.g. static, relative, etc.) when positionin elements because you receive immediately gratification in regards to the look and feel of the changes you are making.

##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

By editing CSS elements within DevTools' style section you can resize certain elements as well as change their positioning.  This is essentially the same way in which you would edit sizing in CSS, except this allows your to do it directly within the browser, thus showing you the immediate results.

##What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static positioning is the default positioning has the programmer using standard methods of positioning and sizing.  Absolute positioning means that the formatting of the element is done in reference to that particular element's first ancestors.  Fixed positioning indicates that the element will be fixed in place on the screen and will not move as the page scrolls.  Thus, Other elements will not respect that element as it has been taken out of the flow. Relative positioning means that all formatting and sizing is relative to that element's original position.

##What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin is the amount of space between that element and other elements on the page.  By adjusting an element's margin you are toggling the acceptable minimum proximity of other elements to that particular element.  Border allows you to place a border of a certain style (e.g. solid, dashed, etc.) and color around the outside of an element.  Padding is similar to margin in that it increases the amount of space that a certain element occupies, however, visually, padding is internal to the element rather than external.  In other words, padding would be used to increase the space between the content of an element and the edge of that element.

##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge gave me a solid understanding of the different types of psotions and sizing options available in CSS.  This challenge provided the opportunity to understand the different ways in which elements behave in relation to one another and how certain positioning and styling options might be better suited for certain situations.
