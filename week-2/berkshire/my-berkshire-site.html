Q: What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
A: It was really cool to work through the process of creating a basic website.  One of the things we really had to think about was how we would use different types of HTML elements based on the type of content.  It was good problem solving this issue and thinking more in depth about the syntactic details of HTML

Q: How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
A: We had to put a surprising amount of thought into this section of our site.  We ended up changing our HTML5 elements several times based on the type of content inside of them.  This exercise was actually a great way to learn how much of an improvement HTML5 elements are over simple divs.  Learning when to use <nav> instead of <section>, for example, was very helpful.

Q: How did you do at keeping best practices?
A: It was a bit of a rough go at first, figuring out which HTML elements to add, but as we coded we were able to really think about which elements were appropriate in different situations.  Using the HTML5 validator was also a great resource when figuring out how to uphold HTML5 best practices

Q: What seems good and bad about HTML?
A: On one hand, it is nice to have more variety in terms of HTML elements in HTML5.  It's easy to see why they added more options.  That makes it easier for those reviewing the code to understand the content of different portions of the website.  However, these added options also make it sometimes more confusing to use HTML as more options can add to the confusion of which one to pick.

Q: What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
A: I've mostly been learning how to use different types of elements based on the content within them.  By doing research and practicing on my own, I can immediately identify the proper HTML element based on what kind of content goes inside of them.
