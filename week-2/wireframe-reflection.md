##What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a rough markup of the layout of a webpage.  UX designers and front-end developers use wireframes to test the appeal of different layouts before committing to creating the website.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing is relatively simple and can be done with wireframing software or with just a pen and paper.  Because wireframing is supposed to be a rough draft, it requires less commitment and resources than coding an entire website before settling on a final version.  Designers can also create multiple wireframes to compare different layouts before committing to one design.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I've never tried wireframing before, yet I found it to be an easy and intuitive way to design a website using simple point and click methods.  I liked being able to use existing templates to see web design best practices.  Considering how easy wireframing was, I could certainly appreciate the ease of use and lack of time required.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I changed my design about 3 times before finally settling on a final design.  I did this by creating three different versions of the webpage and ultimately settling on which one I thought was the most intuitive and pleasing to look at.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge.  What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Since I'm new to UX design, the main question I asked myself is what defines an intuitive design and what are the best practices of web design.  To find answers to my questions I googled web design best practices and worked with some existing templates within wireframing software.  By doing this, I could learn from more seasoned veterans how I should design my site.

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which did you find tedious?

I really enjoyed working with the wireframing software - specifically Balsamiq. I loved being able to point and click on different design options and create my design in a simple and intuitive environment.  This also gave me a chance to ask myself what I valued most in a website.  This was actually one of the few challenges so far that was in no way tedious.  I really enjoyed doing the wireframing mockups and didn't find any parts of this challenge to be unnecessary.
