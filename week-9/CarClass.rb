# Create a Car Class from User Stories


# I worked on this challenge [by myself].


# 2. Pseudocode



# 3. Initial Solution
class Car

    def initialize(model, color)
        @model = model
        @color = color
    end

    def distance=(distance)
        @distance = distance
    end

    def speed
        @speed
    end

end



# 4. Refactored Solution






# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
corvette = Car.new("corvette", "red")
corvette.distance = 15
corvette.speed
