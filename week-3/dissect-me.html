<!--Reflection questions

Q: What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
A: The <section> tag has become a personal favorite.  I like this tag
 because it is general enough - much like a vanilla <div> tag - yet has a
 bit more structure.  <section> tags are great for defining the main
 content of a website and ensuring that the proper structure is used

Q: How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
A: Elements are laid out on a page in the order that they are listed from
top to bottom in the HTML.  The elements are laid out based on their
position in the HTML document as well as their relationship to other HTML
 elements.  This is also usedful when designing the look and feel of the
  page in CSS.

Q: What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? DO you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
A: I really liked that you could create predefined lines of code much like
 you can do in Unix.  This will efinitely come in handy with other
 languages like jQuery and CSS.  This will also be useful if there are
 some common stylings that I use in CSS that I would want to run in
 several other CSS pages.
