A repository is where a project lives.  When using git/GitHub you will have a GitHub repository that lives on GitHub's online platform.  You will also have a cloned version of that repository that lives on your local machine.  To create a repository on GitHub you simply click the new repo button and create a name for your repository.  You will then select what type of license you would like to use simply click "create repo", it's that simple.  To clone that repo on your physical computer you need to create a directory that will act as the folder where that project will live.  First, create a folder with the project name, then move to that folder using "cd [directory name]".  Once there you simply need to type "git clone [repository name]" and git will automatically start tracking any files in that directory.  That means that if you're working on the project that belongs in that repo, you need to save it to the folder you specified and upload it to GitHub from there.  Cloning your online, GitHub repo allows you to upload files from your local machine to the internet.

Open Source is a type of software development in which the source code that makes up the underlying intellectual property (IP) is open to the public for use and collaboration - thus, it is no longer proprietary.  Open source is behind several large projects such as the git and Linux projects and was created so that large communities of developers could collaborate to make better software without the legal issues of proprietary technology.

Open source was created with the principle that "walled gardens" don't make for better products; it is better to utilize a large community of developers to make your product better.  There is also a heavily politicized free software aspect of the open source community.  Personally, I don't see open source as a solution, I see it as an alternative.  Open source software, in its current state, is a great way for people to make valuable contributions to large-scale projects.  It also offers free alternatives to expensive software.  However, Proprietary software is often more refined and more expansive.  One might consider how Mac OSX and Linux are both built on Unix.  OS X is proprietary while Linux is free.  OS x is also largely more refined, better looking, and provides more features.  However, Linux is a great, free option that offers unlimited contributions from independent developers.

Licenses are important because they dictate what a person may or may not do with your intellectual property.  This is especially important within the realm of open source where you must use the proper open source licenses (BSD, MIT, GNU, etc.) to release all proprietary claims and allow other developers to work on your technology.

This was the first piece of coding, despite how minimal, so far and actually showed me what it's like to push real code the GitHub and have it run within a web browser.  Therefore, I received a simulation of the actual process of editing code and pushing it to an online repo.  Putting it into context like this helps me better understand how I will continue to do this in the next three phases of DBC.

I did a little extra reading on open source, specifically Linux.  Here are some links below:
